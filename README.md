### 2008: Pyro Studios - Engineer

Pyro Studios, developers of the Commando saga, was at the time the biggest studio in Spain, so when I got an offer to join them, I didn't hesitate, packed my bag and moved to Madrid on a January 1st. At Pyro Studios **I worked as an Engineer on Quiz Adventure, an ambitious real-time multiplayer game**, unfortunately the project was not released but **it was a great chance to test my server solution, Beam Server, on the context of a big studio**.

### 2006: e-LiteGames - Indie game developer

Since I was a kid and started coding very "BASIC" games on my Amstrad CPC 464, I always wanted to develop computer games. On 2006 I decided to pursue my dream and started working, with a friend, on a Risk-like multiplayer Flash game, the only server solution for Flash multiplayer games in the time was the official Macromedia server, which we couldn't afford, so **we reverse engineered the AMF3 protocol and implemented our own c# server solution for multiplayer games, this project became Beam Server**, a project we later licensed to multiple companies. During 2006 and 2007 **we developed and released a dozen of real-time multiplayer games against Beam Server on our web portal, e-LiteGames**. I was running e-LiteGames until I got hired at Pyro Studios.

### 2001-2008: Otrostudio and freelancing

While studying computer engineering I founded **Otrostudio** with two friends, during the next four years we were developing **web sites and rich internet applications** for a diverse range of clients, including **Trece13, Universidad de Sevilla, Banda de la Mar√≠a, Alex O'Doherty** and many others.

Around 2005 I started freelancing for multiple international companies and agencies. I had the opportunity to collaborate with big brands and companies, such **EA, DKNY, Max Factor, Hello Kitty, Airbus, Opel, AOL, Scion, Adobe, Rogers & Cowan, El Corte Ingl√©s, The1stMovement, and Prusland**, among others. My work involved the development of web experiences, rich internet applications and augmented reality experiences. Additionally, I am proud to have contributed to the creation of the **[FWA award-winning](https://thefwa.com/cases/adobe-acrobat-8-experience){:target="_blank"}** experience for **Adobe Acrobat 8**.
