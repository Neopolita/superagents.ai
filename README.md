### 2006: e-LiteGames - Indie game developer

##### Since I was a kid and started coding very "BASIC" games on my Amstrad CPC 464, I always wanted to develop computer games. On 2006 I decided to pursue my dream and started working on a Risk-like multiplayer Flash game, the only server solution for Flash multiplayer games in the time was the official Macromedia server, which I couldn't afford, so **I reverse engineered the AMF3 protocol and implemented with c# my own server solution for multiplayer games, this project became Beam Server**, a project I later licensed to multiple companies. During 2006 and 2007 **I developed and released a dozen of real-time multiplayer games against Beam Server on my web portal, e-LiteGames**. I was running e-LiteGames until I got hired by Pyro Studios.

### 2008: Pyro Studios - Engineer

##### Pyro Studios, developers of the Commando saga, was at the time the biggest studio in Spain, so when I got an offer to join them, I didn't hesitate, packed my bag and moved to Madrid on a January 1st. At Pyro Studios **I worked as an engineer on Quiz Adventure, an ambitious real-time multiplayer game**, unfortunately the project was not released but **it was a great chance to test my server solution, Beam Server, on the context of a big studio**.
